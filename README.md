# Random Monitors  

These are some of the monitors I created a few years ago to track new product releases, such as **PlayStation 5 consoles** and **various sneaker drops**, back when the market was still highly competitive.  

## How to Use  

To run the monitors, you need to:  
1. Create a `task.csv` file inside each folder, where you will define the products to track.  
2. Add a `proxies.txt` file to handle requests more efficiently.  
3. Open the command prompt and run:  

   ```sh
   py entry.py

## Disclaimer
Since the last update was **over three years ago**, some monitors may no longer work due to website changes or store shutdowns. However, with some modifications, they might still be useful for tracking product availability.
